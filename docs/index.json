[{"categories":["Go","Guide"],"contents":" Go is a programming language developed by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. Go shares a lot of similarities with C programming language. But it has obviously more features than C. Go has garbage collection, structural typing, memory safety etc. Go is really a fast and flexible programming language. In this post I\u0026rsquo;ll guide you through the complete installation of Go programming language in Linux. This guide should work on all Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Arch etc). In case if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work you can comment down below, I would love to help you out. We\u0026rsquo;ll also write our first Go program. So let\u0026rsquo;s get started.\nPrerequisites  Any Linux distribution Internet Love for programming  Installation  Open this URL in favourite browser and download the file for Linux. It will start downloading a .tar file.   Open your terminal and change your directory to the one where you\u0026rsquo;ve downloaded the tar file.\n cd your_directory    Now we have to extract and install the .tar file of Go. Just enter the below command and it will do the job.\n sudo tar -c /usr/local -xzf file_name.tar.gz    The installation is done now. But we have to define the path of our Go installation so that we can use it. I am using nano here, you can use any editor like vim, gedit etc.\n sudo nano ~/.profile  Take your cursor to the bottom and enter the following line as shown in code and screenshot. Then save the changes by using CTRL+O \u0026amp; CTRL+X commands.\n PATH=\u0026quot;$PATH:/usr/local/bin:$PATH\u0026quot;    Now we have to source our changes to system.\n source ~./profile  Now let\u0026rsquo;s verify our installation. Just enter the following command in your terminal.\n go version  If it gives a output similar to the given screenshot then congratulations you\u0026rsquo;ve done and amazing job so far. Go programming language is finally installed on your Linux machine.\n  First Go program  Let\u0026rsquo;s create our first Go program by entering the given command in terminal. I am again using nano here. You can use any text editor.\n nano first.go  Now paste the following code in the editor and save the program by using CTRL+O \u0026amp; CTRL+X\npackage main import \u0026quot;fmt\u0026quot; func main() { fmt.Println(\u0026quot;Hello, Go!\u0026quot;) }  Run the following command\n go run first.go  Hurray! You\u0026rsquo;ve compiled your first ever Go program.\n  So finally we\u0026rsquo;ve installed Go programming language in our Linux system and wrote our very first Go program successfully.\n","permalink":"https://www.vipuljha.com/blog/how-to-install-go-programming-language-golang-in-linux/","tags":null,"title":"How to install Go Programming Language (GoLang) in Linux"},{"categories":null,"contents":"I am an Android Developer who loves to write articles on technology. science and whatever I know.
